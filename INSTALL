Sgo itself only depends on XCB (X protocol C-language Binding)[0],
beyond the usual C development tools. What packages are specifically
required, is listed below.

With these installed, all you have to do is run

    $ make

in this directory.

If you wish to install sgo globally on your system, run

   # make install

To play against a bot, external programms are required. See the
"contrib" subdirectory for ready-made scripts that connect sgo with
various engines.  Note that these assume sgo to be in PATH.

Here follows a list of packages that you'd have to install to build
sgo:

- Debian-based Systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ...):

  # apt install build-essential libxcb1-dev

- RedHat-based Systems (RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, ...):

  # dnf install gcc make libxcb-devel

- OpenBSD:

  # pkg_add xcb

- Void Linux:

  # xbps-install tcc libxcb-devel bmake

  Of course, gcc and GNU make are just as usable.

- GNU Guix:

  $ guix package -i gcc make libxcb
